# Quiz-Game
- The user answers the question With True or False .
- The quiz game was created based on the learning of object oriented programming.
- Where I learned object, class, attributes,methods, class constructor, __init__.
- Learnings were:
- In question_model.py declared question_text,question_answer. Which would help us to acess the answer and questions from data.py which is JSON file.
- In main.py created an empty list so that the data from the data.py will be added into the list called question_bank with question and correct answer pair.
- In quiz_brain.py initialized and created queston_list which can given as the input to the question_bank in main.py as well as question_number so that the question number also increases.
- Then introduced a while loop so that the next question loop keeps on going on.
- Then introduced a still_has question to chekc if there exists an questions in remaining in the list.
- Also introduced Score tro keep track of the score and add it into the total score.
- Also printing the final score of the user gained.
